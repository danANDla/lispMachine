; This program contains macros.
; Macroses are used to make your code more intuitive.
; 
; The standard if-clause in Lisp limits number of forms,
; that will be evaluated if condition is true.
; That is why when you want to execute several instructions
; if condition is true, you should you use progn.
;
; With using macroses you can turn it into
; more understandable code.
;
; In this program when macro is created
; and '(when (> 100 a) (print a) (print a))'
; is turned into '(if (> 100 a) (progn (print a) (print a)))'
; after lispReader translation part.
;
; output_buffer after hlt: 'NN'
;
